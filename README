# Raster-Collection

This package is designed to manage raster timeseries in R. It will wrap functions of the package `raster` and utilizes `rgdal` in order to overcome issues with `raster` package, i.e. loading too much information of the raster data sets into memory when operating on small subsets of particular raster timeseries.

## Install

```R
devtools::install_github(repo="flahn/raster-collection", refs="master")
```
